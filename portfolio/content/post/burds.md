**Burds** is my first attempt at using machine learning to make AI. This involved implementing feed forward neural networks and reccurrent neural networks from scratch, but also developping a genetic algorithm to train these networks, as well a choosing the right network achitecture.
The final result is a mix from several research papers, adding my own contributions to fit the project.
