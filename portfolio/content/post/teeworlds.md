[Teeworlds](https://teeworlds.com) is 2D multiplayer open source game ([available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/380840/Teeworlds/)).
Its development started around 10 years ago, I joined the main team recently to keep the work going. We released a new version (0.7.2) after years of hiatus.
I'm currently working on remaking the editor from scratch (see below).
