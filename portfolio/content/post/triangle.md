Project **Triangle** is a shoot-them-up concept developped to explore and learn 3D rendering techniques, using **bgfx** (A Cross-platform, graphics API agnostic, "Bring Your Own Engine/Framework" style rendering library). A deferred rendering stack was developped from scratch, including shadow mapping, normal mapping, emissive textures, point and directionnal lights, and HDR. A meta programmed Entity Component System was also put it place, allowing easy and flexible gameplay iterations, as well as instant updating in game.
